Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Companyâ€™s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During 2020, aspects of the Companyâ€™s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Companyâ€™s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Companyâ€™s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its'"
